guava concurrent包的一个目的是要实现流式（链式）异步调用，是如何实现的?

CheckedFuture里有这要一段注释：
 * @deprecated {@link CheckedFuture} cannot properly support the chained operations that are the
 *     primary goal of {@link ListenableFuture}. {@code CheckedFuture} also encourages users to
 *     rethrow exceptions from one thread in another thread, producing misleading stack traces.
 *     Additionally, it has a surprising policy about which exceptions to map and which to leave
 *     untouched. Guava users who want a {@code CheckedFuture} can fork the classes for their own
 *     use, possibly specializing them to the particular exception type they use. We recommend that
 *     most people use {@code ListenableFuture} and perform any exception wrapping themselves. This
 *     class is scheduled for removal from Guava in October 2018.
